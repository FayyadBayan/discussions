Q : 
Sometimes recommendation systems get it wrong, to hilarious (or disastrous) effect. In the screenshot below, The Berenstain Bears, an American children’s show, was recommended to the viewer in the “Gory Horror Movie” category. Why do you think this happened? How did an animated children's show get recommended as a gory horror movie?

The Berenstain Bears being recommended as a gory horror movie on Netflix.

For this discussion, find a "surprising" recommendation in your entertainment, social media, or shopping applications (i.e., Amazon, Taobao, Mercari, Netflix, TikTok, Douyin, and/or YouTube). As you can tell, many of your recommendations are based on your history. So, why do you think this surprising item/ad was recommended to you? Could some outside factors (demographics, politics, bad artificial intelligence) cause the surprise?

This is a required discussion and counts toward program completion.


A : Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience with you, which is a bit strange.

I don't know what to write for this discussion, as I live in a country where ads or the like are banned for political reasons, and since I haven't seen any ads or recommendations in the past twenty-four years, I don't know how those who have gone through this experience feel, which is something my friends from other countries envy me for, as it's like you're subscribed to a premium service without really paying. But I recently started to notice that on a platform like Facebook, when I watch a specific video, it is suggested among the videos for my family members on the same network, which is a bit confusing since we don't share accounts or anything that connects devices to each other, so the same video appears for each person in the family only. It also didn't happen on other networks or friends of mine in the same area, so this raises the expectation that it is possible to suggest something specific to people based on the IP of the network they are connected to or the small and narrow geographical circle. I don't know why, but it has gone beyond the concepts we studied recently.


A for question : 
Thank you for this insightful analysis on how YouTube's recommendation system may use browsing and search history to tailor content for users. Your observation about the potential drawbacks of such a system, particularly the narrowing of content diversity, raises an important discussion point.

Given that recommendation systems can create a feedback loop that limits content diversity, how can platforms like YouTube balance personalized recommendations with the need to introduce users to a broader range of content? What strategies could be implemented to prevent users from being confined to a narrow selection of recommendations?
