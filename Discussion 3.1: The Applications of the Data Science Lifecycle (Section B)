Thanks Fayyad, 

I am researching more on the topic and love your feedback that is pointing me to various modeling techniques that I can try as we progress on this course. I did scope the effort and found the prospect of using CNN, causal inferencing as well as uplift modeling as some of the modeling techniques that I can use. I havent elaborated on the pain points yet as I am still looking at the data and the cleanup. Will post that as I get to that point to get more feedforwards.

hi Fayyad, 

Thanks for responding to my post. 

Sorry for delay in commenting.

>>I'm curious, though, how did the team handle challenges related to privacy and data security during data preparation? 

 

The we handled sensitive data was that all access to data classified as PII was not logged. 

 

>>Could you elaborate more on your experience with OSEMN and how it compares to CRISP-DM in real-world scenarios?

 

Just to clarify, I have not used OSEMN in real life. The question suggested exploring other processes. Thus I found details for this process based on pure bench research.
